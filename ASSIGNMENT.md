# apprentice-php-portfolio

## First PHP & Github activity.

 > Now that you've done a commit to your own branch you've used git before and you are configured in [our repository](https://github.com/Karma-Tech-Consulting/apprentice-php-portfolio) and are able to commit on your own branch there, we're ready to do a real project. After that commit you made, I merged your branch into the "master" branch on our github repository, and did some other work, like adding this ASSIGNMENT readme. You need to update your named branch because now the master branch is ahead of your named branch (work has been submitted to the remote repository after you submitted work to it. you need to retrieve it and update your branch) ... I added a screenshot to help with getting the changes updated from github
 
 # Your Assignment:
 
* Merge the "master" branch to your own named branch.

* **Figure out php include other php files**
 * goooogle
* Refactor portfolio.php to use the $links array from links.php - without copying and pasting the data from links.php into portfolio.php
 * see step 2
* Once you have access to $links in portfolio.php, modify the loop so that:
 * Not only does the image HTML with src generate at each iteration of the for loop, in an `<img>` tag
 * The title is interpolated into `<h1>` tags
 * Surround the `<img>` tag by an `<a>` tag - set the href set to the link property. If you recall from code academy HTML those are the instructions for creating a clickable image-link.
* Commit changes often along the way, and when you are done, push your branch with new commits (completing the assignment) to the remote repository to share.
