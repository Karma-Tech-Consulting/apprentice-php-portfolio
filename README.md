# apprentice-php-portfolio
Justin Murdock getting his 2 programming apprentices to learn PHP, Bootstrap's grid system, basic git, meanwhile compiling Justin's portfolio from php to html for github page demo.

In reality, this is a horrible unmaintanable way to go about something like this, I would do it in AngularJS. They'll be learning frontend code soon.
